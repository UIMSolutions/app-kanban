Kanban is a workflow management method designed to help manage and improve work processes.

A typical element are Kanban boards. The individual work processes are shown here. This enables the optimization of work across multiple teams by showing projects at a glance.

Originally developed in the manufacturing industry, Kanban became popular among agile software developers.

Kanban has its roots in Japan, more precisely at Toyota. Kanban means (roughly) visual signal. Kanban is a work management method that originated in the Toyota Production System (TPS) in the late 1940s.

Toyota introduced Kanban for just-in-time production. Based on the Kanban approach, production is aligned with customer demand (pull principle). Cash concepts set certain quantities in advance, which then come onto the market (push principle).

This unique production system laid the foundation for lean production, or simply lean. Its primary purpose is to minimize activities that cause losses without sacrificing productivity. The main goal is to create more value for customers without additional costs.
