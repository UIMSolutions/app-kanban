With this principle, established processes are inserted in a non-disruptive manner to enable continuous change and ensure improvement.

## Principle 1: Start What You Do
Kanban offers the flexibility to apply the method on top of the existing workflows, systems and processes without disrupting the existing elements. The method recognizes that existing processes, roles, responsibilities and titles have their value and it is fundamentally important to maintain them. At the same time, it will identify issues that need to be addressed and help assess and evaluate changes so that their implementation is as disruptive as possible.

## Principle 2: Agree on incremental, evolutionary change
The Kanban method is designed to meet minimal resistance. It continuously encourages small, incremental and evolutionary changes to current processes by introducing forms of collaboration and feedback. In general, sweeping changes are discouraged because they tend to encounter resistance stemming from fear or insecurity.

## Principle 3: Foster leadership at all levels
Leadership at all levels relies on people's everyday insights and actions to improve the way they work. Each shared observation, no matter how insignificant, encourages the continuous improvement mindset (kaizen) to achieve optimal performance at the team, department, and organizational level. This cannot be achieved at management level.
